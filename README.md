```lrc
[00:24.66] To all the days we were together
[00:31.17] To all the time we were apart
[00:37.78] Of each other's lives
[00:44.04] Heart to heart
[00:51.04] 
[00:50.37] And so I had a late arrival
[00:56.78] So, we never saw the start
[01:03.29] Of each other's lives
[01:09.63] Heart to heart
[01:16.63] 
[01:16.04] Heart to heart
[01:22.48] Heart to heart
[01:28.76] Heart to heart
[01:35.13] Heart to heart
[01:42.13] 
[01:41.67] And though it seems so quick and easy
[01:48.03] Sentimentally assumed
[01:54.47] Walking parallels
[02:00.80] Heart to heart
[02:07.80] 
[02:07.18] To all the days we were together
[02:13.53] To all the time we played apart
[02:20.16] In each other's lives
[02:26.47] Heart to heart
[02:33.47] 
[02:32.71] Heart to heart
[02:39.20] Heart to heart
[02:45.63] Heart to heart
[02:52.03] Heart to heart
[02:58.47] Heart to heart
[03:04.82] Heart to heart
[03:11.13] Heart to heart
[03:17.55] Heart to heart
[03:24.55] 
[03:25.93] Weo! Weo! Weo! Weo!
[03:27.89] Heh-heh
